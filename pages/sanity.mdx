## If setting up own CMS

Note: The `.env` keys are pre-set up with a Sanity Studio with few sample events.

If you are using your own Sanity CMS project keys, you need to create a project on Sanity CMS first.

1. Create a new project on Sanity

http://localhost:3000
```

```text copy
http://localhost:4000
```

Create a new API token (with developer permission)

Update the following `.env` files with your keys

```js copy
# https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cms-sanity#using-the-sanity-cli

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=<your-sanity-project-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=<your-sanity-dataset-name>
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=<your-sanity-api-token>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_TOKEN=<your-sanity-api-token>
```

## How to populate events using Sanity Studio

2. Open http://localhost:3000/studio or http://localhost:4000/studio in your browser to access Sanity Studio.
